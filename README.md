# Asynchronous file upload API

REST API to perform asynchronous file uploads. Developed using java 8, it supports file upload upto 100 MB(Default size set to 100MB with provision to alter this value in a file named "application.properties"). The API doesnt require a dedicated servlet container since it is built over spring-boot with an embedded tomcat. All one needs to do is perform a maven build to fetch the desired jar(asynchronous-file-upload-1.0.jar) boot up the application as illustrated in usage information and start performing file upload requests using any REST client such as chrome POSTMAN. There is a sample illustration of using this API using the plugin in a file titled "screenshots.doc" For more details on POSTMAN please refer to https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction

Usage:
java -jar asynchronous-file-upload-1.0.jar
